# Xgen Plugin Date Information Plus #

**Tested up to:** WordPress 4.0

Displays WordPress plugin LastUpdated, Last Installed, Last Activated &amp; Last Deactivated timestamps in columns on the plugins page.

This is a fork of Xgen Plugin Date Information (https://wordpress.org/plugins/xgen-date-information) with some fixes and additions by me. You can simply overwrite the files already in that folder via FTP if you have the plugin already installed, or install it manually as you would any other WordPress plugin.

## ChangeLog ##

* Initial release: 1.1 to 1.2
	* Fixed the CSS style sheet not working. That path was coded wrong.
	* Moved the Menu to the plugin's settings page off of the main WordPress menu and placed it as a subitem of the regular WordPress Setting's menu. This makes things look more organized and reduces plugin clutter.
	* Added ability to choose your own time/date stamp formats. You can either customize them yourself or leave the fields empty to use WordPress's default settings.
	* Some English corrections, as the original author is from India and I'm from the U.S., to make things a bit clearer.
	* Some style and display formatting changes.
	* Many code formatting changes (not visible to non-developers).
